#### ⭐️EXTRA/TMI

Kyle Simpson's _You Don't Know JS_ series of books has been around for 5+ years which is about 1000 years in JS time. He is currently updating the whole series and kindly shares all of his writing on GitHub. He's still writing the second edition of his book on `this` & Object prototypes, so you'll have to make do with the first edition. I find that he is really good at explaining things clearly, although this is not really beginner material. Still, if you need to know more, I would recommend reading what he has to say.

- [You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes - 1st Edition](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/1st-ed/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes---1st-edition)

This covers the basic details of using the canvas element, and goes deeper in things like drawing curves and custom shapes and using sprites:
