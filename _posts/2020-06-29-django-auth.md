You've now seen how to handle data in a Django application with basic operations in these categories:

* **Create** - when we add a new model instance to the database
* **Read** - when we query the database to look up existing data
* **Update** - when we query the database to find existing data so we can change it
* **Destroy** - when we query the database to find data that we want to delete

At the heart of many web applications you'll find variations on this theme, so we'll continue to practice it.

Today we'll add in another essential part of web applications: user registration and login.
