Today we'll continue talking about model relationships and see how to do a data migration.

## Homework Review Questions

- If we want to show one particular book in the browser, how does that work in the urls and the views?
- How do forms work in Django? You should be able to talk about form objects and how forms are handled in the views.
- How does Django know if a user is logged in?
- How can you implement books with multiple categories?

## Project: FreeShelf Day 3

Your FreeShelf application is due tomorrow morning.
