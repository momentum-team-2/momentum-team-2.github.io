## Your assignment, if you choose to accept it

There are _definitely_ things in this assignment we haven't covered in class! That probably seems very scary, but practicing reading documentation and figuring it out is an important part of becoming a developer. I am going to link all necessary documentation below under Resources.

## Resources

- [DRF - Authentication](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/) - read up on `TokenAuthentication` here
- [djoser](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - this is a library to add registration to your API. Its documentation is not the best, unfortunately. Luckily for you...
- [The Ultimate Tutorial for Django REST Framework: Login and Authentication](https://sunscrapers.com/blog/django-rest-framework-login-and-authentication/) - this blog post covers setting up djoser in detail and does it well.
- [DRF - Filtering](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/) - this will show you about how to filter your output based on GET parameters.
- [Django - Managers](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/managers/) - you can set up default sorting through a custom manager. **Note**: this is not necessary to complete the project.
