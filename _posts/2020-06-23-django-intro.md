Today, we'll start learning about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). To work with this framework that helps us build web applications, we need to know about two other things:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)

## Project

This is a week-long project, due next Monday.
