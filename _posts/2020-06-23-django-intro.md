Today, we'll start learning about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). To work with this framework that helps us build web applications, we need to know about two other things:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)

## Project

This is a week-long project, due next Monday.

* [Django Application: Uptact](https://classroom.github.com/a/Krrq08rl)


## Resources

*  [Julia Evans Networking Zine](https://jvns.ca/networking-zine.pdf) -> This is a lot of info but for now take a look at the part about HTTP messages.
* [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)
* [An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
* [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)
* [Django Topic Guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/)
* [MDN Django Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) -> See especially the [Intro section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Introduction)
* [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) -> This is a free and open source GUI (or _graphical user interface_) for inspecting the structure of and tables in a database. A SQLite database is just a file (this isn't true of all databases), so you can just open the `db.sqlite3` file that's in your project from within DB Browser for SQLite.
