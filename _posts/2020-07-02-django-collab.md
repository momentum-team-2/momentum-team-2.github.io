Today we'll begin our first shared project. This will require more planning, a lot of communication and coordination, and adding on some new git skills that will let us collaborate.

## Project: Django Duplex

You will work in a shared repo for this and turn in one application that your team will build together. How you share the work is up to you.

## Resources

- [GitHub Collaboration Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests)
- [Git in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/versioncontrol) -> I use git on the command line and that's how I teach people to use it. But you might like using the integration in VS Code. This is a good place to start, but there are many other extensions that you could use as well.
- [Pair Programming Guide](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide/template) -> This template for a pairing session is practical and actionable. There are other resources on this site worth a look as well.
- [Django cheat sheet](https://github.com/lucrae/django-cheat-sheet) -> This is the same one I posted earlier in the week. If you didn't see it then, you might be glad to see it now.
- [Django Project Template](https://github.com/momentumlearn/django-project-template) -> This template will give you a django project structured like the same ones you've been working with. You'll still need to run `startaapp` to set up your app.
