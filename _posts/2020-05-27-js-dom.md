#### ⭐️EXTRA/TMI

This resource is really not at all necessary to understand or do the project, _but_ if you want to know more about the concept of tree structures in computer science, check out this piece from [Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series](https://medium.com/basecs). She is awesome! There is also a thoroughly delightful accompanying [BaseCS podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) with the equally amazing Saron Yitbarek.

And here is more info about what is happening when a browser renders a page -- very interesting, but definitely not necessary at this stage:
- [Browser rendering engine](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#The_rendering_engine)

Since this came up in class, I'll add a reference here. This is the documentation for the ternary operator, the alternative syntax some folks used in their JS functions. Most helpful for short expressions -- you'll also see it used in React:
- [MDN ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)

AND...if you would like to know more about the JavaScript Event Loop and how it works, I highly recommend this resource. Don't miss the video of the conference talk that goes along with it -- it's excellent:
