# Team Two Phase 4 Agreement

* What do you want out of this final project?
* What do you need from your teammates to make this final project a success?

## Joey

### Goals

I want to come out at the end with meaningful software that solves/addresses a real problem or fills some gap that needs to be filled.

### Priorities

Covered in the other two, I think.

### Experiences

I definitely wouldn’t want this to be in-the-box as far as doing more of what we’ve done so far.  What that means will really depend on the project, but different libraries/DB structures/concepts.  I would like the project scope and goals to dictate the tools rather than the tools we already know dictating the project.  In short, I want the group to reach toward new things to solve problems rather than allowing unknowns to reduce project scope.

### What do I need?

Hard to answer in the general.  I guess all the stuff about communication and such covers it in general terms.  Fearlessness?  Go-get-em attitudes?  It’s only two weeks of life — so giving it all the time and energy it needs (while defending one’s mental/physical health).

Otters only if necessary to the final product.


## Rajee

### Experience

Ideally to replicate an actual workplace environment as close as possible (hopefully with a little less stress)

### Priorities

To keep organization intact, not have to scramble to finish, be transparent and fair with team members

### Spec tech experience

implementing more design and styling would be great. locational/gps tech seems applicable to a lot of situations; AR?

### Practice

JS as always, but really a good brushing up with anything/everything wouldn't hurt

### Teammate needs

Continued support as they have already demonstrated :) (Everyone that's currently in our group that is)

## Russell

### What do you want out of this final project?

The confidence that I can do this professionally.

### Priorities

Finishing my tasks in a timely manner, being better at not waiting to the last moment.
Getting better at using Github
Getting stronger at writing views
Get better at reading and implementing documentation.

### Team needs

Good sense of humor -'get off my back'
NO OTTERS.


## Shelby

### experience

a collaborative experience with equal contribution and mutual respect -- I want to feel confident and prepared for interviews and working in a professional environment

### priorities

time management, communication, respect, pushing myself out of my comfort zone

### technical

learn some about React, different JS libraries and JS in general to make a more user friendly experience -- look more into writing documentation and what that entails, testing

### team

- respect, good communication, hard work, patience
- availability

## Tyler

### What do you want out of this final project?

* Try and find a good workflow working with a team so I can carry that knowledge into the workplace and somewhat know what I'm doing

* To create a final product that presents as a professional, fully featured production-ready app

* To learn more about react and libraries that can make working with it easier

### What do you need from your teammates to make this final project a success?

* Good communication; myself included

* Otters must be included
